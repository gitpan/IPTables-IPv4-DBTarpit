                  Netfilter Core Team Security Advisory
                  
                           CVE: CAN-2003-0187

Subject:

  Netfilter / Connection Tracking Remote DoS

Released:

  01 Aug 2003

Effects:

  Any remote user may be able to DoS a machine with netfilter connection
  tracking when running a specific version of the Linux kernel.

Estimated Severity:
  High.

Systems Affected:

  Linux 2.4.20 kernels (kernels <= 2.4.19 and >= 2.4.21 NOT affected)
  CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK enabled, or the ip_conntrack module loaded.

Solution:

  BEST: Upgrade to Linux kernels 2.4.21 (stable), or apply the patch below.

  OR: Do not use connection tracking on 2.4.20 based systems.

Details:

  The 2.4.20 kernel introduced a change in the behaviour of the generic
  linked list support.  The connection tracking core relies on the old
  behaviour to identify 'UNCONFIRMED' connections.  
  
  'UNCONFIRMED' means we've seen traffic only in one direction, but not
  in the other.  Since connection tracking was unable to identify such
  connections correctly anymore, they've been assigned a very high
  timeout.

mangle)

                  Netfilter Core Team Security Advisory
                  
                           CVE: CAN-2003-0467

Subject:

  Netfilter / NAT Remote DoS

Released:

  01 Aug 2003

Effects:

  Under limited circumstances, a remote user may be able to crash a
  machine doing Network Address Translation (NAT).

Estimated Severity:

  Medium.

Systems Affected:

  Linux 2.4.20 kernels and recent 2.5 kernels with
  CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_FTP or CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_IRC enabled, or the
  ip_nat_ftp or ip_nat_irc modules loaded, on which ftp and irc users
  are not packet filtered out.

Solution:

  BEST: Upgrade to Linux kernels 2.4.21 (stable), or apply the patch below.

  OR: As a workaround, the modules can be removed, or iptables can
  be used to block untrusted users from initiating ftp or irc
  connections through the NAT machine.

Details:

  This was verified by Rusty Russell on 2.4.20, and verified fixed
  with this patch.

Vendor Statement:

  Red Hat: All of the 2.4.20-based kernels shipped by Red Hat already
           contain the patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.
  Others:  unknown

               Cartel Sécurité --- Security Advisory

Advisory Number: CARTSA-20020402
Subject:         Linux Netfilter NAT/ICMP code information leak
Author:		 Philippe Biondi 
Discovered:      2002, April 2
Published:       Not yet
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Do not release in public before May 8, 2002.

Problem description
===================

The following bug exists in the netfilter NAT implementation: When the
first packet of a connection is hitting a NAT rule, and this packet
causes the NAT box itself to reply with an ICMP error message, the
inner IP packet inside the ICMP error message is not un-NAT'ed
correctly.  This leads to the ability to discover which ports of a
host are NATed and where the packet will really go. This can also lead to
those ICMP error packets being dropped by stateful firewalls not
recognizing
the related connection.


Vulnerable versions
===================

All kernel patches from iptables package < ipables-1.2.6a are vulnerable.
All versions of kernel >= 2.4.4 and up to (at least) 2.4.19-pre6 use a
vulnerable version.
