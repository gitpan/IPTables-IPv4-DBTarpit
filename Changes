0.34  Sat Nov 13 15:55:29 PST 2004
	fix typo in docs
	IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit::Config
      should be:
	IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit::SiteConfig
	This messed up SpamCannibal on-line documentation

0.33  Wed Jun 30 17:11:41 PDT 2004
	Tune docs on DNAT
	Tune QUEUE documentation

	Seperate the libipq functions in tarpit.c into libipq_wrapper.c 
	to work around a conflict between net/if.c and linux/if.c included
	in libnet.h and libipq.h

0.32  Sun Jun 27 14:01:44 PDT 2004
	updated the documentation to include bastion host DNAT
	instructions for setting up a tarpit connection where 
	the server is behind the bastion host

0.31  Wed Jun 23 16:37:13 PDT 2004
	updated rc.dbtarpit v0.05 to fix bug for perl v5.8.3 where unshift 
	does not work properly for default @_

	add workaround to MAKE process to find misplaced libipq.h in debian
	distribution

0.30  released only for testing -- changes included above

0.29  Fri May 28 17:26:33 PDT 2004
	Update source for tarpit.c to reflect the API change between   
	libnet-1.0.x and libnet-1.1.x. Add code to test in make and 
	detect which version of libnet is present; create a header 
	file that passes necessary info to the compiler + ifdef
	tarpit.c to use the correct API

	consolidate the library test code for linbet-1.1.x and
	iptables-1.28? into 'local_config'

0.28  Mon May 24 14:12:39 PDT 2004
	As of rev 1.28? of iptables, the call to ipq_create_handle
	has gained an arg for support of IPv6 (not supported here).
	Add code  to test in the make sequence and detect the newer 
	library version; create a header file that passes necessary 
	info to the compiler + ifdef main.c to call ipq_create_handle 
	with one or two arguments as appropriate.

0.27  Sat May 22 10:24:53 PDT 2004
	removed compiler dependent bug when extracting version number
	from DBTarpit.pm for C sources.

0.26	not released
	altered the comments at the beginning of DBTarpit.pm

0.25  Tue Apr  6 22:08:13 PDT 2004
	remove 'sync' from bdbtarpit.c "dbtp_find_addr",
	put a call to "dbtp_sync" in check.c, conditional on
	the time of last sync being over 15 minutes old. This 
	will reduce DB write operations to the disk under heavy load.

0.24  Mon Feb  9 15:56:51 PST 2004
	rewrite 'restart' logic in rc.dbtarpit v0.4

0.23  Sat Dec  6 17:36:49 PST 2003
	plugged a leak in libnet-1.02a
	virtual memory use goes up after a call to 
	  ptr = libnet_open_link_interface
	and does not go back down when calling
	  libnet_close_link_interface(ptr)

	adding a call to free(ptr) in tarpit.c, seems to do the trick

0.22  Sat Oct  4 17:27:29 PDT 2003
	put a check in libdbtarpit to prevent keys that are not netaddrs
	from being entered into the databases.

	update the test suites to accomodate above

	incorporate auto-delete of records that are not IPv4 address size
	into 'getrecno' to prevent inadvertent database corruption

0.21  Fri Oct  3 16:23:17 PDT 2003
	clean up db recovery interface in bdbtarpit.c so it works

	Unlink pid file on exit in main.c This lets the database 
	watcher know that the task has exited cleanly.
