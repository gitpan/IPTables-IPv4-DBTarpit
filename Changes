Revision history for Perl extension IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit.

0.23  Sat Dec  6 17:36:49 PST 2003
	plugged a leak in libnet-1.02a
	virtual memory use goes up after a call to 
	  ptr = libnet_open_link_interface
	and does not go back down when calling
	  libnet_close_link_interface(ptr)

	adding a call to free(ptr) in tarpit.c, seems to do the trick

0.22  Sat Oct  4 17:27:29 PDT 2003
	put a check in libdbtarpit to prevent keys that are not netaddrs
	from being entered into the databases.

	update the test suites to accomodate above

	incorporate auto-delete of records that are not IPv4 address size
	into 'getrecno' to prevent inadvertent database corruption

0.21  Fri Oct  3 16:23:17 PDT 2003
	clean up db recovery interface in bdbtarpit.c so it works

	Unlink pid file on exit in main.c This lets the database 
	watcher know that the task has exited cleanly.
