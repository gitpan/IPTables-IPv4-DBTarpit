=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit::Tools> provides utilities to manage the database for
B<IPtables> QUEUE packets delivered to user space routine dbtarpit. Utilities are available to 
add/update the DB file as well as get, remove, and expire the host ip's in the databases.

=over 4

=item * $DBTP_ERROR;

The code returned by the last DB operation. A text string representing the
code will be returned by:

=item * $string = db_strerror($DBTP_ERROR);

Return a string describing the error condition in $DBTP_ERROR.

=cut

sub db_strerror {
  return t_db_strerror($_[0]);
}

=item * $tool = new IPTables::IPv4::DBTarpit::Tools(%hash);

Open a database environment and its databases and return its reference.
Returns undef on failure.

  %hash = (
	# defaults shown - one or more db's
	dbfile	=>	['tarpit','... etc'],
	dbhome	=>	'/var/run/dbtarpit',
	umask	=>	007,
  # optional
	txtfile	=>	['name1','... etc'],
	recover	=>	1,
  );

	dbhome	=>	'/var/run/dbtarpit',

Default if not present.
Location of BerkeleyDB sub-system files.

The leading directories must be present and writable. 

	dbfile	=>	['tarpit','...etc'],

Default is 'tarpit' if not present. However, if 'dbfile' is omitted and
'txtfile' is present, no 'dbfile' will be forced by default.
BerkeleyDB file located in B<dbhome> containing 
keys which are four byte ip address's 
(as returned by inet_aton() and values which are 
time in seconds since epoch of the record update.

The combined maximum total number of open dbfiles + txtfiles must be 10 or
less.

Multiple db files may be created, each referenced
in other methods by the file name specified. The
dbname will be the B<file> portion of the path/file
database name.

The home directory and database will be created if they do not exist.
However, the parent directories for B<dbhome> must already exist and have
adequate premissions.

	umask	=>	007,

Default if omitted. Files and directories are created
with mode 0666 and 0777, respectively, masked with 
'umask' of 007 by default.

	txtfile	=>	['name1','name2', etc...]

Optional database(s) that take text as the B<value>. The databases specified
by B<dbfile> only accept and return unsigned long timestamps.

	recover =>	1, # any true value

Use this flag if the Berkeley DB returns a DB_RUNRECOVERY error. The
database environment is destroyed and recreated. Since the databases for
this application are not transactional, the DB_RECOVER flag is not
applicable. DBENV->remove is called to remove the corrupt environment.
All other threads must be stopped and this thread run by itself. 
See the Berkeley DB documentation for further details.

See: B<DATABASE CONFIGURATION FILE>
below for additional configuration options.

NOTE: (in BIG LETTERS!)

Berkeley DB provides a "1" based numbering system for record numbers. i.e.
the first record number is "1". Attempting to access record "0" will create

  returns:	ZERO on success

  Update or insert a record into named database

  USE caution, do not insert text values into databases
  specified with B<dbfile>. You will get erroneous results.

=cut

  input:	dbname,

		$timestamp   or current time

  returns:	ZERO on success
		  or
		non-zero, see BerkeleyDB documentation

  Updates or creates or updates record with the
  $timestamp or current epoch time in seconds if
  $timestamp is not present. 

  (may be used to put arbitrary non-zero values in
  the database for test purposes -- this will break
   normal operations)

sub touch {

  put($tool,$db,$addr,$timestamp);
}

=item * $rv = $tool->sync($db);

Flush the cached pages of the database to file. $tool->sync() should be
performed after database update (remove, put, touch) when the operation(s)
are complete.

  input:	db name
  returns:	false on success or
		Berkeley DB error code

Clear a database of all records.

}

=item * $rv = $tool->cull($db,$age,\%hash,$nop);

  input:	dbname,
		age in seconds from now,
		hash pointer,
		no operation = true

  returns:	number of keys removed

Fills the %hash with 4 byte IP address and time tag
for each address older than $age seconds from 
the current time.

If $nop is false, the %hash represents the addresses
deleted from the database. If $nop is true, no 
action is taken on the database. The %hash is just
returned showing what action is proposed.

This operation can consume a lot of memory and is intended primarily for use
in testing on smallish databases.
Use a tied %hash if you expect large arrays.

=cut

sub cull {
  my($tool,$db,$age,$hashpoint,$nop) = @_;

  }
  return $keycount;
}

=item * $rv = $tool->dump($db,\%hash);

  input:	dbname,
		pointer to hash

  returns:	0 on success
		  or
		BerkeleyDB error code

Returns the hash filled with the contents
of the database.

This operation can consume a lot of memory and is intended primarily for use
in testing on smallish databases. 
Use a tied %hash if you expect large arrays.

  t_dump($tool->{_db}->{"$db"},$hp,$tool->{_dbf});
}

=cut

=item * $number = $tool->nkeys($db)

Returns the number of unique keys (or records) in a connected database. If
there is an error, it return undef and sets the error number in $DBTP_ERROR.

  input:	database name
  returns:	number of keys
		or zero

Note: zero is a perfectly good answer. If the error number is also zero,
then that's the real answer.

=cut

sub nkeys {
  my($tool,$db) = @_;
    unless (exists $tool->{_db}->{"$db"}) {

  t_nkeys($tool->{_db}->{"$db"});
}

=item * ($string,$major,$minor,$patch)=bdbversion();

Returns the version of the installed Berkeley DB.

  input:	none
  output:	scalar context, a string
		describing the version
    or		array context, the string
		as above followed by the
		major, minor, and patch
		revision levels

=cut

sub bdbversion {
  t_bdbversion();
}

=item * ($string,$major,$minor,$patch)=libversion();

Returns the version of the bdbtarpit library.

  input:	none
  output:	scalar context, a string
		describing the version
    or		array context, the string
		as above followed by the
		major, minor, and patch
		 revision levels

=cut

sub libversion {
  t_libversion();
}

=item * $netaddr = inet_aton($dotquad);

Provided for convenience. This method is the same as the one in Socket from
perl 5.8.
Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to
the 4-byte string (structure). Takes arguments of both the 
'blackhole.spamcannibal.org' type and '86.1.2.4'. If the
host name cannot be resolved, returns undef.
For multi-homed hosts (hosts with more than one address), the
first address found is returned.

=item * $dotquad = inet_ntoa($netaddr);
	
Provided for convenience. This method is the same as the one in Socket from 
perl 5.8.	
Takes a four byte ip address (as returned by inet_aton()) and
translates it into a string of the form 
'd.d.d.d' where the 'd's are numbers less than 256 (the normal
readable four dotted number notation for internet addresses).

=back

=head1 DATABASE CONFIGURATION FILE [optional]

Usually used to increase database cache size.

Most of the configuration information that can be specified to 
DB_ENV methods can also be specified using a configuration file. 
Any file named DB_CONFIG in the database home directory will be 
read for lines of the format NAME VALUE.

One or more whitespace characters are used to delimit the two parts of 
the line, and trailing whitespace characters are discarded. All empty 
lines or lines whose first character is a whitespace or hash (#) 
character will be ignored. Each line must specify both the NAME and the 
VALUE of the pair. The specific NAME VALUE pairs are documented in the 
Berkeley DB manual for the corresponding methods.

inet_aton and inet_ntoa have been included with a few modifications from
perl-5.80 by Larry Wall, copyright 1989-2002. Thank you Larry for making
PERL possible for all of us.

Much of how to write this module and the bdb functions in the SpamCannibal
package I learned from reading the source code of Paul Marquess's
BerkeleyDB-0.20. The versioning information for Berkeley DB was all taken
directly from Paul's module. Thanks Paul.
